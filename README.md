# Workshop Introduction to Text Mining in R and RStudio

The purpose of this introduction to Text Mining and Word Embedding Models in R is to familiarize participants of the workshop with these techniques and to help them incorporate them in their methodological workflow. Machine readable text corpora are increasingly available to researchers, as well as a growing variety of digital techniques to extract information from this data. This document outlines the basic steps you need to start your own Text Mining research project. 

This repository contains all the materials needed for the Text Mining Workshop at C2DH in Luxembourg.
